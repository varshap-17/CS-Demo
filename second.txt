git revert [--[no-]edit] [-n] [-m <parent-number>] [-s] [-S[<keyid>]] <commit>…​
git revert (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)
Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record them. 
This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).
Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one).
