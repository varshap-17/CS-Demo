From a content perspective, rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to 
another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit. 
Internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits and applying them to the specified base. 
It's very important to understand that even though the branch looks the same, it's composed of entirely new commits.
